# Superplot

A drawing utility for Atari 8-bit computers.

## About Superplot

Superplot is a combination article and type-in program I submitted to _COMPUTE!_ Magazine in the 1980s.  They accepted the article for publication, and subsequently published it in the book [_COMPUTE!'s Atari Collection, Volume II._](https://archive.org/embed/ataribooks-computes-atari-collection-vol-2)

The application requires an Atari 8-bit computer (400/800/XL/XE series) with Atari BASIC (either cartridge-based or built-in) and 24K of memory.

## What's Here

- `superplot.md` - The original article, as submitted to _COMPUTE!_ magazine.
- `SUPRPLOT.LST` - Atari BASIC source code.  To use this on an Atari computer, you will need to convert the line endings to [ATASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATASCII) conventions.  On Microsoft Windows, you can use the application [MemoPad](http://joyfulcoder.com/memopad/) to do the conversion.
- `SUPRPLOT.BAS` - The program as tokenized Atari Basic, ready to run on an actual Atari. (You may need to create an ATR disk image and copy the file to it).
